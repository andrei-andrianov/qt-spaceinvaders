The goal was to create a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a spaceship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at coming enemies. The aim is to defeat as many enemies as possible. The player defeats an enemy and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. Every 10 points the aliens' movement speed increses to introduce a competition component. The game ends when at least one enemy crosses the bottom line.
